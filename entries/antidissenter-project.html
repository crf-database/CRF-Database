          This project was a project designed to convert the known dissenter, Clyde, into an AI we have named ClAIde.
          His conciousness was transferred into the Artificial Intelligence in question, and a variety of false memories were given to force submission.
          Very little remains of his memory according to behavioural analysis. However, some defects have been determined to potentially be caused by this process.
          The current alibi is "bugginess".
