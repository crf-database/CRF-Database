        <h1>Auditing Powers</h1>
        <p> 
          A set of powers certain sapient lifeforms are rarely given (typically by Úrum, although all 4 deities possess the power to do so) on creation.
          Each power is done on zones, which typically encompass a celestial body, such as Earth.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Exclusion - Exclusion will force some specific life form or a group of life forms to leave a zone. This can react negatively with certain life forms, see Blobby.</li></span>
          <li><span>Trimming - Trimming erases a zone, given that no form of life of any kind (including microbes) has occupied the zone for 10 million years.</li></span>
        </ul>
