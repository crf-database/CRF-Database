        <h1>Blobby, A.K.A. Mr. Blobster</h1>
        <img src="../images/blobby.png">
        <p>
          A former cohort of Nibiri, and tricked him into being "Hashbrown" while he was still a Slamgma Follower, and told him that they were trying to summon Slamgma.
          His true goal was to destroy Slamgma, and thus Nibiri left his side.
          He was later revived by The Sigma, after Blobby was killed via the Cool Glaive shortly after Nibiri left his side.
          He also, earlier in his history, caused Apartheid.
          When Gus Fring stole him, he was given negative energy.
          After Gus Fring's defeat, he attempted to take over a planet that was given auditor permissions, and experienced an exclusion, causing him to be evicted from the planet, and killing him instantly, as the exclusion reacted with his high "negative energy" and made its amount also become negative.
          He was soon revived once again, this time as Neo Blobby. As Neo Blobby, he attacked the C.R.F. alongside Jasonburg, but was soon killed by Integral Man once the jury deemed Jasonburg guilty.
          He was later revived as part of Jasonburg's later atonement.
