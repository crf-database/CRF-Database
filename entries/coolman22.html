          coolman22 is the founder of the C.R.F. He handles a variety of things, including making primary directives, and overall keeping systems runnning.
          As the founder, he started the C.R.F. overall, and thus has Clearance Level 100.
          He has since been involved in nearly every incident so far.
          At one point, he attempted to destroy the planet using the Improbability Device, but didn't realise at the time that it would destroy the entire universe. 
          Once he learnt that, he wound up aiding in fixing his own mistakes, and has since been forgiven.
          He also has an obssession with Macbeth for some reason.
