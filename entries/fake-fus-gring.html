          The Fake Fus Gring was secretly Blobby in disguise; he had attempted to also utilise a body double of himself to basically trick the C.R.F into going right
          into his plans. He would end up kidnapping Coolman and tried to threaten the C.R.F into destruction albeit with no success. He would end up being exorcised
          successfully via the 'roasting' technique of Nibiri's that would end up making way for the real Fus Gring and also Gus Fring himself to return.
