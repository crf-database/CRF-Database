        <h1>Gus Fring</h1>
        <p>
          Gus Fring ran a meth empire. He attempted to restart his business, but got seriously walloped by Sigma 3, and was stranded on Schmars. 
          He soon began growing his power while on Schmars, and became Super Saiyan.
          He then stole Blobby and brought him back to Schmars, which led to Sigma 3 going onto Schmars and fighting Gus Fring, leading to Gus fring being erased from existence via Sigma 3's powers.
          This resulted in an implosion.
          Later, his soul was absorbed by Blobby, and when Gus Fring's body quickly reformed, he had to be provided a new soul.
          He accepted containment.
