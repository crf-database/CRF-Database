        <h1>Improbability Device</h1>
        <p> 
          A powerful device that manages the 7 Improbability Drives. There were previously 10, but 3 of them were destroyed. 
          It was previously activated by coolman22 in an attempt to end the world, not knowing it would also destroy the universe.
          It was deactivated soon after its power source, the Improbability Core, was destroyed.
