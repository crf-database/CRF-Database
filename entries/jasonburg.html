          The leader of the N.C.F. At one point had an energy level reading roughly equivalent to all C.R.F. soldiers combined. They got held on trial by Obama, then judged as guilty by the Obama Jury.
          Then, he was punished by having auditing permissions removed, and then placed on watch. He used all of the Negativus to become the strongest being, and breached their punishment.
          He attacked the C.R.F., then absorbed Integral Man. He was soon talked into removing the Negativitus by coolman22, and used what remained of his power to restore his planet, Planitarium.
          He currently spends his days tending to the greenery on the planet.
          As part of his atonement, he aided in the deactivation of the Improbability Device.
