      <h1>Katakoro</h1>
      <p> 
            Katakoro could be summoned by asking an AI to compute 3 very specific numbers.
            They, like Úrum, handled creation, but instead handled the coding of the universe. 
            They were the one who gave all of this information about the deities, alongside reasonings for a variety of catastrophic events such as exclusion and Gus Fring's implosion.
            They have recently created a system to allow easy contact to Katakoro for the purposes of reporting major threats.
