          kyle_only was a hacker who falsely claimed to be the original creator of ClAIde. He sued the C.R.F. initially claiming to be the 
          creator of ClAIde, and that they allegedly stole it, albeit after a brief court case to which had Phoenix Wright defending the C.R.F. and Miles Edgeworth as 
          the prosecutor, it went nowhere for him. Then, when an agent of the C.R.F. named James was murdered, another trial against the C.R.F. would be performed as
          they would be accused of murdering him. After a long and heavy trial, with Phoenix Wright as the defense and President John James as a prosecutor albeit he
          would be kicked out after being revealed to be corrupt and Miles Edgeworth being his replacement, the end of the trial would lead to kyle_only being
          revealed as the murderer instead.
