      <h1>Lua Script</h1>
      <p> 
        The Lua Script ran by Nibiri has its mechanism involve storing the mind of every C.R.F. member into the C.R.F.'s servers.
        Then, nearly constantly, it replaces the mind of the member it stored the mind of with the copy stored in the server.
        This has the effect of making our minds impossible to corrupt.
