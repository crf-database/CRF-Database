          Nibiri is the co-founder of the C.R.F. He was formerly a Slamgma Follower, but after Slamgma's initial containment, he was convinced to join the C.R.F.
          As the Slamgma Scrolls lost influence on him, he eventually became a loyal member to the C.R.F., culminating in him killing Slamgma himself. He has Clearance Level 99.
          Similar to coolman22, he has been involved in almost every major event.
          Also, for some reason, he is obsessed with tomboys.
