        <h1>Planitarium (Planet-88129889123)</h1>
        <p> 
          A planet that Blobby once attempted to take over. It had auditor permissions, and thus excluded Blobby eventually, killing him instantly. 
          Formerly home to the Negative Corrections Facility (N.C.F.), which was run by Jasonburg.
          It housed several containment cells at one point, alongside Negativus, but when Jasonburg used his remaining power to restore the planet, they were both relatively abolished.
