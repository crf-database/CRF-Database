        <h1>Schmars</h1>
        <p> 
          Schmars is a planet of unknown location. It was mainly where the battle between Sigma 3 and Gus Fring took place, and currently has taken a severe amount of damage as a result.
          Beyond this, the planet is overall unimportant due to its lack of any sentient life, or any life for that matter.
