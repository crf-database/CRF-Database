        <h1>The Slamgma Scrolls</h1>
        <p> 
          The Slamgma Scrolls are a set of scrolls that were devoted to worshipping Slamgma. The first scrolls were created by the Sigma. 
          Later, they were ammended to by the First Slamgma Follower, and eventually had a hex placed on them so that they would corrupt the minds of whoever read them.
          Once read, they would cause who read them to start devoting their entire life to Slamgma. This is why Nibiri was initially a Slamgma Follower for most of his life.
          They are currently under containment by the C.R.F., and the Lua script prevents the scrolls from affecting their minds nowadays.
