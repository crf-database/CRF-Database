        Slamgma was the false deity created by the Sigma. He was worshipped by the Slamgma Followers, which included Nibiri.
        He destroyed the minds of the Slamgma Followers, with exception of Nibiri, although he was about to destroy Nibiri's mind before his intiial containment.
        After initial containment, he was accidentally summoned, and then quickly recontained.
        Soon, Nibiri read a scroll that detailed how to defeat Slamgma. This gave Nibiri the idea to use the mind protecting Lua script he wrote earlier to destroy Slamgma.
        This succeeded, and Slamgma's vessel was later occupied by Úrum temporarily while their memory was gone.
