        <h3>The Sigma</h3>
        <p> 
          The Sigma was formerly simply known as a mysterious entity, although their name was always known. 
          They were The Destroyer, but did their job poorly, and kept trying to create a deity themself, called Slamgma. 
          As a result of this, they were unfavoured by the others.
          They later revived both Botha and Blobby, and attacked the C.R.F.
          Initially, he tried to recruit Pelle, but got trapped in a Doomed Reality, and killed himself to escape, causing him to be reincarnated as The Obamic Sigma.
          He was defeated by Úrum after launching a second attack on the C.R.F, resulting in his reincarnation as Sigma 3.
          After The Obamic Sigma was defeated, Obama revived the Sigma as a nicer entity, thus making the newest recruit, Sigma 3.
          They have displayed powers that can only be described as both comical, yet exceedingly useful.
          Their current most notable feat is using their powers to erase Gus Fring from existence, although this caused the universe to retaliate with an implosion (as Gus Fring had an extreme amount of energy), resulting in Sigma 3 being injured heavily.
