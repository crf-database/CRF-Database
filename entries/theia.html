        <h1>Theia</h1>
        <p>
          A former prisoner of the Cracking Research Facility that was formerly under our dimension's C.R.F. custody. She was imprisoned for going against her dimension's C.R.F., as she is the opposite of Nibiri.
          Due to the fact that Nibiri was actually a villain for most of his life, she ended up having good morals.
          She has since gotten herself a home, and is currently under therapy.
