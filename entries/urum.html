      <h1>Úrum</h1>
      <p> 
            Úrum was a new recruit in the C.R.F. before their status as deity was discovered. 
            They were nicknamed Echo before this revelation, as they had lost their memory due to the Sigma betraying them, thus not knowing their true name was Úrum. 
            Their role as a deity is as the creator of all things physical.
            Once they regained their memory, they went back to their duties as Úrum, although did show up at the C.R.F. once to fulfill a duty relating to creating a vessel for recently dead Blobby as a result of exclusion.
