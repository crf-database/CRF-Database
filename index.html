      <p> 
        This is the C.R.F. Database. Here, a variety of info about the C.R.F. will be stored.
        The first thing you should be aware of is that you already have most of the info given to you as-is. However, this will add clarification for certain concepts you may be confused about.

      <p> 
        The Lua Script ran by Nibiri has its mechanism involve storing the mind of every C.R.F. member into the C.R.F.'s servers.
        Then, nearly constantly, it replaces the mind of the member it stored the mind of with the copy stored in the server.
        This has the effect of making our minds impossible to corrupt.
