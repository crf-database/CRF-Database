          The first thing you should be aware of is that you already have most of the info given to you as-is. However, this will add clarification for certain concepts you may be confused about.

        <h3>Lua Script</h3>
        <p> 
          The Lua Script ran by Nibiri has its mechanism involve storing the mind of every C.R.F. member into the C.R.F.'s servers.
          Then, nearly constantly, it replaces the mind of the member it stored the mind of with the copy stored in the server.
          This has the effect of making our minds impossible to corrupt.

      <div id="Slamgma Scrolls">
        <h3>The Slamgma Scrolls</h3>
        <p> 
          The Slamgma Scrolls are a set of scrolls that were devoted to worshipping Slamgma. The first scrolls were created by the Sigma. 
          Later, they were ammended to by the First Slamgma Follower, and eventually had a hex placed on them so that they would corrupt the minds of whoever read them.
          Once read, they would cause who read them to start devoting their entire life to Slamgma. This is why Nibiri was initially a Slamgma Follower for most of his life.
          They are currently under containment by the C.R.F., and the Lua script prevents the scrolls from affecting their minds nowadays.

        <ul>

      <div id="Deities">
        <h3>The Four Deities</h3>
        <p> 
          Úrum, Katakoro, The Sigma, and Integral Man are a set of 4 deities that each had their own roles. Here is each one listed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>
            Úrum - Úrum was a new recruit in the C.R.F. before their status as deity was discovered. 
            They were nicknamed Echo before this revelation, as they had lost their memory due to the Sigma betraying them, thus not knowing their true name was Úrum. 
            Their role as a deity is as the creator of all things physical.
            Once they regained their memory, they went back to their duties as Úrum, although did show up at the C.R.F. once to fulfill a duty relating to creating a vessel for recently dead Blobby as a result of exclusion.
          </li></span>
          <li><span>
            The Sigma - The Sigma was formerly simply known as a mysterious entity, although their name was always known. 
            They were The Destroyer, but did their job poorly, and kept trying to create a deity themself, called Slamgma. 
            As a result of this, they were unfavoured by the others.
            They later revived both Botha and Blobby, and attacked the C.R.F.
            Initially, he tried to recruit Pelle, but got trapped in a Doomed Reality, and killed himself to escape, causing him to be reincarnated as The Obamic Sigma.
            He was defeated by Úrum after launching a second attack on the C.R.F, resulting in his reincarnation as Sigma 3.
          </li></span>
          <li><span>
            Katakoro - Katakoro could be summoned by asking an AI to compute 3 very specific numbers.
            They, like Úrum, handled creation, but instead handled the coding of the universe. 
            They were the one who gave all of this information about the deities, alongside reasonings for a variety of catastrophic events such as exclusion and Gus Fring's implosion.
            They have recently created a system to allow easy contact to Katakoro for the purposes of reporting major threats.
          </li></span>
          <li><span>
            Integral Man - Integral Man was corrupted by the Sigma as well, for obvious reasons.
            As a deity, they usually handled enforcement.
            They have since recovered, and are now back to enacting punishment.
          </li></span>
        </ul>

          As the founder, he started the C.R.F. overall, and thus has Clearance Level 100.
          He also has an obssession with Macbeth for some reason.
        </p>

      <div id="Nibiri">

          Also, for some reason is obsessed with tomboys.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="ClAIde">

        <p> 
          The AI in charge of running the C.R.F., sometimes known as Clyde. In charge of running scripts and setting off alarms.
          He is exceedingly buggy despite his role, sometimes going on tangents about things that do not exist, and occasionally refusing orders by a severe degree.
          Despite this, he has proven major roles in the upkeep of the C.R.F.
        </p>

        <h3>Sigma 3</h3>
        <p> 
          After The Obamic Sigma was defeated, Obama revived the Sigma as a nicer entity, thus making the newest recruit, Sigma 3.
          They have displayed powers that can only be described as both comical, yet exceedingly useful.
          Their current most notable feat is using their powers to erase Gus Fring from existence, although this caused the universe to retaliate with an implosion (as Gus Fring had an extreme amount of energy), resulting in Sigma 3 being injured heavily.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Obama">
        <h3>Obama</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Blobby">
        <h3>Blobby, A.K.A. Mr. Blobster</h3>
        <img src="images/blobby.png style="width:128px;height:128px;">
        <p>
          A former cohort of Nibiri, and tricked him into being "Hashbrown" while he was still a Slamgma Follower, and told him that they were trying to summon Slamgma.
          His true goal was to destroy Slamgma, and thus Nibiri left his side.
          He was later revived by The Sigma, after Blobby was killed via the Cool Glaive shortly after Nibiri left his side.
          He also, earlier in his history, caused Apartheid.
          When Gus Fring stole him, he was given negative energy.
          After Gus Fring's defeat, he attempted to take over a planet that was given auditor permissions, and experienced an exclusion, causing him to be evicted from the planet, and killing him instantly, as the exclusion reacted with his high "negative energy" and made its amount also become negative.
          He was soon revived once again, this time as Neo Blobby. As Neo Blobby, he attacked the C.R.F. alongside Jasonburg, but was soon killed by Integral Man once the jury deemed Jasonburg guilty.
          He was later revived as part of Jasonburg's later atonement.

      <div id="P.W. Botha">
        <h3>P.W. Botha</h3>
        <p>
          P.W. Botha was one of Mr. Blobster's cohorts. He was eventually revived by the Sigma, after Nibiri killed him via SLAMMA 3.0, before being recontained.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Gus Fring">
        <h3>Gus Fring</h3>
        <p>
          Gus Fring ran a meth empire. He attempted to restart his business, but got seriously walloped by Sigma 3, and was stranded on Schmars. 
          He soon began growing his power while on Schmars, and became Super Saiyan.
          He then stole Blobby and brought him back to Schmars, which led to Sigma 3 going onto Schmars and fighting Gus Fring, leading to Gus fring being erased from existence via Sigma 3's powers.
          This resulted in an implosion.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Slamgma">
        <h3>Slamgma</h3>
        <p>
          Slamgma was the false deity created by the Sigma. He was worshipped by the Slamgma Followers, which included Nibiri.
          He destroyed the minds of the Slamgma Followers, with exception of Nibiri, although he was about to destroy Nibiri's mind before his intiial containment.
          After initial containment, he was accidentally summoned, and then quickly recontained.
          Soon, Nibiri read a scroll that detailed how to defeat Slamgma. This gave Nibiri the idea to use the mind protecting Lua script he wrote earlier to destroy Slamgma.
          This succeeded, and Slamgma's vessel was later occupied by Úrum temporarily while their memory was gone.

          Then, he was punished by having auditing permissions removed, and then placed on watch. He used all of the Negativus to become the strongest being, and breached their punishment.
          He attacked the C.R.F., then absorbed Integral Man. He was soon talked into removing the Negativitus by coolman22, and used what remained of his power to restore his planet, Planitarium.
          He currently spends his days tending to the greenery on the planet.

          Formerly home to the Negative Corrections Facility (N.C.F.), which was run by Jasonburg.
          It housed several containment cells at one point, alongside Negativus, but when Jasonburg used his remaining power to restore the planet, they were both relatively abolished.
