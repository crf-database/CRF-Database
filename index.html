      <div id="Deities">
        <h3>The Four Deities</h3>
        <p> 
          Úrum, Katakoro, The Sigma, and Integral Man are a set of 4 deities that each had their own roles. Here is each one listed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>
            Úrum - Úrum was a new recruit in the C.R.F. before their status as deity was discovered. 
            They were nicknamed Echo before this revelation, as they had lost their memory due to the Sigma betraying them, thus not knowing their true name was Úrum. 
            Their role as a deity is as the creator of all things physical.
            Once they regained their memory, they went back to their duties as Úrum, although did show up at the C.R.F. once to fulfill a duty relating to creating a vessel for recently dead Blobby as a result of exclusion.
          </li></span>
          <li><span>
            Katakoro - Katakoro could be summoned by asking an AI to compute 3 very specific numbers.
            They, like Úrum, handled creation, but instead handled the coding of the universe. 
            They were the one who gave all of this information about the deities, alongside reasonings for a variety of catastrophic events such as exclusion and Gus Fring's implosion.
            They have recently created a system to allow easy contact to Katakoro for the purposes of reporting major threats.
          </li></span>
          <li><span>
            Integral Man - Integral Man was corrupted by the Sigma as well, for obvious reasons.
            As a deity, they usually handled enforcement.
            They have since recovered, and are now back to enacting punishment.
          </li></span>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="coolman22">
        <h3>coolman22</h3>
        <img src="images/coolman22.png">
        <p> 
          coolman22 is the founder of the C.R.F. He handles a variety of things, including making primary directives, and overall keeping systems runnning.
          As the founder, he started the C.R.F. overall, and thus has Clearance Level 100.
          He has since been involved in nearly every incident so far.
          At one point, he attempted to destroy the planet using the Improbability Device, but didn't realise at the time that it would destroy the entire universe. 
          Once he learnt that, he wound up aiding in fixing his own mistakes, and has since been forgiven.
          He also has an obssession with Macbeth for some reason.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Nibiri">
        <h3>Nibiri</h3>
        <img src="images/nibiri.png">
        <p> 
          Nibiri is the co-founder of the C.R.F. He was formerly a Slamgma Follower, but after Slamgma's initial containment, he was convinced to join the C.R.F.
          As the Slamgma Scrolls lost influence on him, he eventually became a loyal member to the C.R.F., culminating in him killing Slamgma himself. He has Clearance Level 99.
          Similar to coolman22, he has been involved in almost every major event.
          Also, for some reason, he is obsessed with tomboys to an almost crippling degree at points.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="ClAIde">
        <h3>ClAIde</h3>
        <img src="images/claide.gif">
        <p> 
          The AI in charge of running the C.R.F., sometimes known as Clyde. In charge of running scripts and setting off alarms.
          He is exceedingly buggy despite his role, sometimes going on tangents about things that do not exist, and occasionally refusing orders by a severe degree.
          Despite this, he has proven major roles in the upkeep of the C.R.F.
        </p>

      <div id="Dessenter">

        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Gus Fring">
        <h3>Gus Fring</h3>
        <p>
          Gus Fring ran a meth empire. He attempted to restart his business, but got seriously walloped by Sigma 3, and was stranded on Schmars. 
          He soon began growing his power while on Schmars, and became Super Saiyan.
          He then stole Blobby and brought him back to Schmars, which led to Sigma 3 going onto Schmars and fighting Gus Fring, leading to Gus fring being erased from existence via Sigma 3's powers.
          This resulted in an implosion.

          Formerly home to the Negative Corrections Facility (N.C.F.), which was run by Jasonburg.
          It housed several containment cells at one point, alongside Negativus, but when Jasonburg used his remaining power to restore the planet, they were both relatively abolished.
