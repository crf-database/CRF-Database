      <h1 class="title">C.R.F. Database</h1>
      <p> 
        This is the C.R.F. Database. Here, a variety of info about the C.R.F. will be stored.
        The first thing you should be aware of is that you already have most of the info given to you as-is. However, this will add clarification for certain concepts you may be confused about.

      <h2 class="title">Lua Script</h2>
      <p> 
        The Lua Script ran by Nibiri has its mechanism involve storing the mind of every C.R.F. member into the C.R.F.'s servers.
        Then, nearly constantly, it replaces the mind of the member it stored the mind of with the copy stored in the server.
        This has the effect of making our minds impossible to corrupt.

      <h2 class="title">The Slamgma Scrolls</h2>
      <p> 
        The Slamgma Scrolls are a set of scrolls that were devoted to worshipping Slamgma. The first scrolls were created by the Sigma. 
        Later, they were ammended to by the First Slamgma Follower, and eventually had a hex placed on them so that they would corrupt the minds of whoever read them.
        Once read, they would cause who read them to start devoting their entire life to Slamgma. This is why Nibiri was initially a Slamgma Follower for most of his life.
        They are currently under containment by the C.R.F., and the Lua script prevents the scrolls from affecting their minds nowadays.

      <h2 class="title">The Four Deities</h2>
      <p> 
        Úrum, Katakoro, The Sigma, and Integral Man are a set of 4 deities that each had their own roles. Here is each one listed:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Úrum - Úrum was a new recruit in the C.R.F. before their status as deity was discovered. 
            They were known as Echo before this revelation, as they had lost their memory due to the Sigma betraying them. 
            Their role as a deity is to be the creator of all things physical.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Sigma - The Sigma was formerly simply known as a mysterious entity, although their name was always known. 
            They were The Destroyer, but did their job poorly, and kept trying to create a deity themself, called Slamgma. 
            As a result of this, they were unfavoured by the others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Katakoro - Katakoro could be summoned by asking an AI to compute 3 very specific numbers.
            They, like Úrum, handled creation, but instead handled the coding of the universe. 
            They were the one who gave all of this information about the deities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integral Man - Integral Man was corrupted by the Sigma as well, for obvious reasons.
            As a deity, they usually handled enforcement. 
          </li>
        </ul>
